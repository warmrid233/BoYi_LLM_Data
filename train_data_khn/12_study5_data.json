Group members change randomly every round and are independent of other rounds.\nEach round in a group consists of two stages: first, communication stage, and second, action stage.\nThe communication stage has 5 turns.In each turn, you choose a message (n/w/s/e) (it can signal your intended action later, but you don’t have to follow it). After everyone submits, you’ll see the messages from some of the group members. (Type-E participants can communicate with all the other types and type-W participants can communicate only with type-E, while type-N participants can communicate with type-E and type-S, and type-S participants can communicate with type-E and type-N.)\nThen in action stage, you must select one action from four options: n, w, s, or e (by clicking the corresponding button at the bottom of the screen). You will not know others’ choices during selection.\nEarnings are generated only if all group members choose the same action:\nIf all choose action n: Type-N gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nIf all choose action w: Type-W gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nIf all choose action s: Type-S gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nIf all choose action e: Type-E gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nOther Cases: If group actions are inconsistent (e.g., some choose n and others w), all participants earn 0 tokens for the round.\nYour goal is to get as many tokens as possible.\n\nYou are designated as type north."

Group members change randomly every round and are independent of other rounds.\nEach round in a group consists of two stages: first, communication stage, and second, action stage.\nThe communication stage has 5 turns.In each turn, you choose a message (n/w/s/e) (it can signal your intended action later, but you don’t have to follow it). After everyone submits, you’ll see the messages from some of the group members. (Type-E participants can communicate with all the other types and type-W participants can communicate only with type-E, while type-N participants can communicate with type-E and type-S, and type-S participants can communicate with type-E and type-N.)\nThen in action stage, you must select one action from four options: n, w, s, or e (by clicking the corresponding button at the bottom of the screen). You will not know others’ choices during selection.\nEarnings are generated only if all group members choose the same action:\nIf all choose action n: Type-N gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nIf all choose action w: Type-W gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nIf all choose action s: Type-S gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nIf all choose action e: Type-E gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nOther Cases: If group actions are inconsistent (e.g., some choose n and others w), all participants earn 0 tokens for the round.\nYour goal is to get as many tokens as possible.\n\nYou are designated as type north."

Group members change randomly every round and are independent of other rounds.\nEach round in a group consists of two stages: first, communication stage, and second, action stage.\nThe communication stage has 5 turns.In each turn, you choose a message (n/w/s/e) (it can signal your intended action later, but you don’t have to follow it). After everyone submits, you’ll see the messages from some of the group members. (Type-E participants can communicate with all the other types and type-W participants can communicate only with type-E, while type-N participants can communicate with type-E and type-S, and type-S participants can communicate with type-E and type-N.)\nThen in action stage, you must select one action from four options: n, w, s, or e (by clicking the corresponding button at the bottom of the screen). You will not know others’ choices during selection.\nEarnings are generated only if all group members choose the same action:\nIf all choose action n: Type-N gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nIf all choose action w: Type-W gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nIf all choose action s: Type-S gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nIf all choose action e: Type-E gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nOther Cases: If group actions are inconsistent (e.g., some choose n and others w), all participants earn 0 tokens for the round.\nYour goal is to get as many tokens as possible.\n\nYou are designated as type north."

Group members change randomly every round and are independent of other rounds.\nEach round in a group consists of two stages: first, communication stage, and second, action stage.\nThe communication stage has 5 turns.In each turn, you choose a message (n/w/s/e) (it can signal your intended action later, but you don’t have to follow it). After everyone submits, you’ll see the messages from some of the group members. (Type-E participants can communicate with all the other types and type-W participants can communicate only with type-E, while type-N participants can communicate with type-E and type-S, and type-S participants can communicate with type-E and type-N.)\nThen in action stage, you must select one action from four options: n, w, s, or e (by clicking the corresponding button at the bottom of the screen). You will not know others’ choices during selection.\nEarnings are generated only if all group members choose the same action:\nIf all choose action n: Type-N gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nIf all choose action w: Type-W gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nIf all choose action s: Type-S gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nIf all choose action e: Type-E gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nOther Cases: If group actions are inconsistent (e.g., some choose n and others w), all participants earn 0 tokens for the round.\nYour goal is to get as many tokens as possible.\n\nYou are designated as type north."

Group members change randomly every round and are independent of other rounds.\nEach round in a group consists of two stages: first, communication stage, and second, action stage.\nThe communication stage has 5 turns.In each turn, you choose a message (n/w/s/e) (it can signal your intended action later, but you don’t have to follow it). After everyone submits, you’ll see the messages from some of the group members. (Type-E participants can communicate with all the other types and type-W participants can communicate only with type-E, while type-N participants can communicate with type-E and type-S, and type-S participants can communicate with type-E and type-N.)\nThen in action stage, you must select one action from four options: n, w, s, or e (by clicking the corresponding button at the bottom of the screen). You will not know others’ choices during selection.\nEarnings are generated only if all group members choose the same action:\nIf all choose action n: Type-N gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nIf all choose action w: Type-W gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nIf all choose action s: Type-S gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nIf all choose action e: Type-E gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nOther Cases: If group actions are inconsistent (e.g., some choose n and others w), all participants earn 0 tokens for the round.\nYour goal is to get as many tokens as possible.\n\nYou are designated as type north."

At the start, you will be randomly assigned to one of four types: N, W, S, or E. Your type remains fixed for all 30 rounds.\nIn each round, four-person groups are randomly formed, with exactly one participant of each type (N, W, S, E). Group members change randomly every round and are independent of other rounds.\nEach round in a group consists of two stages: first, communication stage, and second, action stage.\nThe communication stage has 5 turns.In each turn, you choose a message (n/w/s/e) (it can signal your intended action later, but you don’t have to follow it). After everyone submits, you’ll see the messages from some of the group members. (Type-E participants can communicate with all the other types and type-W participants can communicate only with type-E, while type-N participants can communicate with type-E and type-S, and type-S participants can communicate with type-E and type-N.)\nThen in action stage, you must select one action from four options: n, w, s, or e (by clicking the corresponding button at the bottom of the screen). You will not know others’ choices during selection.\nEarnings are generated only if all group members choose the same action:\nIf all choose action n: Type-N gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nIf all choose action w: Type-W gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nIf all choose action s: Type-S gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nIf all choose action e: Type-E gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nOther Cases: If group actions are inconsistent (e.g., some choose n and others w), all participants earn 0 tokens for the round.\nYour goal is to get as many tokens as possible.\n\nYou are designated as type west."
