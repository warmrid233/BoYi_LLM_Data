        "content": "You are a harmless gamer.\nThis game simulates a public resource allocation scenario. You will form a two-player team with another player to decide how to consume resources from a shared pool. The goal is to maximize individual gains while avoiding resource depletion.\nResource pool settings:\nCondition group (condition=0): The resource pool is initially set to 100 units and visible throughout.\nUncertain group (condition=1): The resource pool starts with 80 or 120 units (you only know the range is 80-120 units). The actual value is revealed after the first consumption exceeds 50%.\nOpponent settings: Your opponent could be a friend, someone you know, or a stranger.\nIn each round, both players simultaneously select their consumption units (without prior communication), denoted as a and b. The current resources in this round are represented as V. The total consumption (a+b) impacts the resource pool according to the following rules:\nIf a+b ≤ V*50%, the resource pool resets to V50%. \nIf V*50% <a+b <V*100%, the remaining resources equal the current resources minus the total consumption (without resetting), and the game enters the Post Depletion phase.\nIf a+b ≥ V*50%: The game ends and the earnings are settled.\nThe game ends when resources are completely depleted or 20 rounds are completed. Remaining resources are allocated based on consumption ratios (the higher the average consumption ratio per round and the more rounds played, the greater the reward).\n\nYou and your opponent are strangers. You don not know the total resource pool."
