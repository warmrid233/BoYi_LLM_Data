The game consists of 17 rounds.\nThe rules were as follows:\n In each round, the proposer would select 0-70 points from 100 points to keep for themselves, with the remaining points evenly distributed among the responders. After getting points, each responder can contribute 0-10 points to prevent the proposer from receiving points. The chance of preventing differs with different rules:\n1.Easy: Convex function relationship, a small contribution can achieve a high rejection probability.\n2.Medium: The rejection probability increases linearly with the collective contribution.\n3.Hard: For the concave function relationship, all respondents must contribute their maximum values to achieve a high rejection probability.\nAll in all, the more points the responders contribute, the more likely they are to prevent you from keeping the points you have taken in this round (maximum probability is 95%).\nFor each participant, the more points they end up with, the better.\n\nThe game’s rule is Easy.You are the Participant 2 of Group 5. You are the Responder."

The game consists of 17 rounds.\nThe rules were as follows:\n In each round, the proposer would select 0-70 points from 100 points to keep for themselves, with the remaining points evenly distributed among the responders. After getting points, each responder can contribute 0-10 points to prevent the proposer from receiving points. The chance of preventing differs with different rules:\n1.Easy: Convex function relationship, a small contribution can achieve a high rejection probability.\n2.Medium: The rejection probability increases linearly with the collective contribution.\n3.Hard: For the concave function relationship, all respondents must contribute their maximum values to achieve a high rejection probability.\nAll in all, the more points the responders contribute, the more likely they are to prevent you from keeping the points you have taken in this round (maximum probability is 95%).\nFor each participant, the more points they end up with, the better.\n\nThe game’s rule is Easy.You are the Participant 3 of Group 6. You are the Responder."

The game consists of 17 rounds.\nThe rules were as follows:\n In each round, the proposer would select 0-70 points from 100 points to keep for themselves, with the remaining points evenly distributed among the responders. After getting points, each responder can contribute 0-10 points to prevent the proposer from receiving points. The chance of preventing differs with different rules:\n1.Easy: Convex function relationship, a small contribution can achieve a high rejection probability.\n2.Medium: The rejection probability increases linearly with the collective contribution.\n3.Hard: For the concave function relationship, all respondents must contribute their maximum values to achieve a high rejection probability.\nAll in all, the more points the responders contribute, the more likely they are to prevent you from keeping the points you have taken in this round (maximum probability is 95%).\nFor each participant, the more points they end up with, the better.\n\nThe game’s rule is Easy.You are the Participant 3 of Group 8. You are the Responder."

The game consists of 17 rounds.\nThe rules were as follows:\n In each round, the proposer would select 0-70 points from 100 points to keep for themselves, with the remaining points evenly distributed among the responders. After getting points, each responder can contribute 0-10 points to prevent the proposer from receiving points. The chance of preventing differs with different rules:\n1.Easy: Convex function relationship, a small contribution can achieve a high rejection probability.\n2.Medium: The rejection probability increases linearly with the collective contribution.\n3.Hard: For the concave function relationship, all respondents must contribute their maximum values to achieve a high rejection probability.\nAll in all, the more points the responders contribute, the more likely they are to prevent you from keeping the points you have taken in this round (maximum probability is 95%).\nFor each participant, the more points they end up with, the better.\n\nThe game’s rule is Medium.You are the Participant 4 of Group 36. You are the Responder."

The game consists of 17 rounds.\nThe rules were as follows:\n In each round, the proposer would select 0-70 points from 100 points to keep for themselves, with the remaining points evenly distributed among the responders. After getting points, each responder can contribute 0-10 points to prevent the proposer from receiving points. The chance of preventing differs with different rules:\n1.Easy: Convex function relationship, a small contribution can achieve a high rejection probability.\n2.Medium: The rejection probability increases linearly with the collective contribution.\n3.Hard: For the concave function relationship, all respondents must contribute their maximum values to achieve a high rejection probability.\nAll in all, the more points the responders contribute, the more likely they are to prevent you from keeping the points you have taken in this round (maximum probability is 95%).\nFor each participant, the more points they end up with, the better.\n\nThe game’s rule is Easy.You are the Participant 1 of Group 38. You are the Proposer."

The game consists of 17 rounds.\nThe rules were as follows:\n In each round, the proposer would select 0-70 points from 100 points to keep for themselves, with the remaining points evenly distributed among the responders. After getting points, each responder can contribute 0-10 points to prevent the proposer from receiving points. The chance of preventing differs with different rules:\n1.Easy: Convex function relationship, a small contribution can achieve a high rejection probability.\n2.Medium: The rejection probability increases linearly with the collective contribution.\n3.Hard: For the concave function relationship, all respondents must contribute their maximum values to achieve a high rejection probability.\nAll in all, the more points the responders contribute, the more likely they are to prevent you from keeping the points you have taken in this round (maximum probability is 95%).\nFor each participant, the more points they end up with, the better.\n\nThe game’s rule is Hard.You are the Participant 2 of Group 53. You are the Responder."

After getting points, each responder can contribute 0-10 points to prevent the proposer from receiving points. The chance of preventing differs with different rules:\n1.Easy: Convex function relationship, a small contribution can achieve a high rejection probability.\n2.Medium: The rejection probability increases linearly with the collective contribution.\n3.Hard: For the concave function relationship, all respondents must contribute their maximum values to achieve a high rejection probability.\nAll in all, the more points the responders contribute, the more likely they are to prevent you from keeping the points you have taken in this round (maximum probability is 95%).\nFor each participant, the more points they end up with, the better.\n\nThe game’s rule is Medium.You are the Participant 3 of Group 64.
