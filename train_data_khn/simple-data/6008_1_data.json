All participants act as trustees (Player B) and engage in a game with a predefined \"investor (Player A)\". \nExplicit condition (40 rounds): The investor's initial endowment (E) is known. The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."

The investor determines an investment (I) for the trustee, which is then multiplied by 4 (multiplier M=4) to form the trustee's disposable fund pool (I×M). The trustee must determine the return ratio (RR) to the investor and retain the remaining portion.\nAmbiguous conditions (80 rounds): The investor's endowment is unknown, with only the transfer amount (I) and three possible endowment values (corresponding to low, medium, and high trust levels: 0.05–0.25,0.35–0.50,0.70–1.00) provided. The trustee must determine the return amount based on the fuzzy information.\nTrust level: Measured by the \"Investment Amount/Endowment\" (I/E) ratio, it is categorized into low (<0.33), medium (0.33–0.66), high (>0.66), and ambiguous(amb) conditions."
