Each participant will choose how to allocate their tokens among four boxes. The four boxes are labeled and shown in a row. The position of the boxes is determined randomly and one box is labeled with a black circle and the others with a white circle. You and the participant you have been paired with in that decision problem see the same display of boxes.\nEach participant must allocate every token before proceeding to the next decision problem. You do that by writing the number of tokens you want to allocate to certain box in the slot below. You can use decimal numbers.\nIn every decision problem, each box is worth 15 points.Your chances of winning a particular box are given by the number of tokens that you allocated divided by the total number of tokens allocated by you and the other participant. In case both participants allocate zero to the same box, each participant has 50 percent chance of winning that box. You can earn points by winning a box.\nYour objective is to earn as many points as possible.\n\n"
