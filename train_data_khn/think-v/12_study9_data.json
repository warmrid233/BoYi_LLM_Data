Group members change randomly every round and are independent of other rounds.\nEach round in a group consists of two stages: first, communication stage, and second, action stage.\nThe communication stage has 2 turns.In each turn, you choose a message (n/w/s/e) (it can signal your intended action later, but you don’t have to follow it). After everyone submits, you’ll see the messages from some of the group members. (Type-E participants can communicate with all the other types and each of the other three types can communicate only with type-E.)\nThen in action stage, you must select one action from four options: n, w, s, or e (by clicking the corresponding button at the bottom of the screen).
