        "content": "Using a within-subject design, participants completed a stag hunt game under four distinct conditions to activate gender identity or minimal group division by manipulating avatar types (gender-specific vs. neutral) and match objects (same gender/neutral vs. different gender/neutral). The four experimental conditions were as follows: \nSame Gender Avatar (SG): Participants matched with opponents of the same gender, both avatars being gender-specific (male/female).\nGender-specific avatars (DG): Participants were matched with opposite-sex opponents, and their avatars were gender-specific.\nNeutral avatar (SN): Participants were matched with opponents using the same neutral avatar.\nDifferent neutral avatars (DN): Participants were matched with opponents using different neutral avatars.\nProfile picture allocation rules: Gender-specific profile pictures are assigned based on participants' self-reported gender, while neutral profile pictures are randomly assigned to avoid social status or demographic implications from names.\n\nHunting game rules: \nParticipants engage in a two-player game against anonymous opponents, choosing between 'cooperation (stag)' and 'betrayal (hare)'. The payoff matrix is: \nBoth players cooperate: each receives 60 points .\nOne partner cooperates while the other betrays: the cooperator gets 0 points , the betrayer gets 40 points .\n Both players betray: 40 points each.\nYour final reward will depend on a randomly chosen gameplay from the 4 conditions.\n\nYou are male."
