Bidders can click the \"Exit\" button at any time to leave, and they cannot rejoin after exiting.\nInformation hiding: Bidders cannot see other bidders' exit prices.\nWhen four bidders withdraw, the remaining bidder becomes the winner and pays the price of the fourth withdrawing bidder.\nProfit calculation: Winner's profit = CV - the fourth-place withdrawal price, with all other bidders' profits being 0.\nYour goal is to become the winner with the highest profit value."
