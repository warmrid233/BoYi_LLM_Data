A win earns 2 virtual points, a draw earns 1 point, and a loss results in zero points.\nThe multi-AI model consists of multiple individual AI units (e.g., AI1 to AI5 or AI1 to AI10), but its core mechanism dynamically selects the currently best-performing AI unit as the next round's combat strategy through a' focus length' (F=5).\n\nYour opponent is a multi-AI model with 5 AI components."
