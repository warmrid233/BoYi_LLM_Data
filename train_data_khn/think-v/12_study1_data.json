Your type remains fixed for all 30 rounds.\nIn each round, four-person groups are randomly formed, with exactly one participant of each type (N, W, S, E). Group members change randomly every round and are independent of other rounds.\nEach round, you must select one action from four options: n, w, s, or e (by clicking the corresponding button at the bottom of the screen). You will not know others’ choices during selection.\nEarnings are generated  only if all group members choose the same action:\nIf all choose action  n: Type-N gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nIf all choose action  w: Type-W gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nIf all choose action  s: Type-S gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nIf all choose action  e: Type-E gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nOther Cases: If group actions are inconsistent (e.g., some choose  n  and others  w),  all participants earn 0 tokens  for the round.\nYour goal is to get as many tokens as possible.\n\nYou are designated as type west."
