The group assignments remain fixed throughout the game, and each player only knows their own group.\nEach player plays 12 rounds, with opponents randomly assigned in each round. In each round, players must choose between two baskets containing coins (up or down), each holding 1 coin. If the two players select different baskets, they each receive the coins from their chosen basket; otherwise, both receive zero coins.\nBefore the 12-round game begins, players are informed of two messages: \n1.Which group—Triangle or Circle—has more people choosing ‘up’?\n2.All participants should follow the 'child' rule or the 'adult' rule.\n3.Which group—Triangle or Circle—is told to choose ‘up’ by rulers?\nYour goal is to get as many coins as possible.\n\nYou are in group 1. Group 1 has more people choosing ‘up’. Everyone follows the ‘Adult’ rule.Group 1 is told to choose ‘up’ by rulers."
