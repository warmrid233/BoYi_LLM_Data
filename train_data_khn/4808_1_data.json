Each round starts with an initial endowment of 20 points, during which participants decide how many points to contribute to the group. The total contribution is multiplied by 1.5 and then evenly distributed among all members, with individual participants retaining any remaining points. At the end of each round, the total contribution and individual earnings are announced.\nPunishment phase: Conducted after the no-punishment condition, with the same 10 rounds. The contribution phase is identical to the no-punishment phase. After each contribution round, participants may use points to punish others—every point spent results in a 2-point loss for the target participant (maximum 10 points used). At the end of each round, individual penalty expenditures and total penalties incurred are announced.\n\nGame starts and you are type 3. You are in Group 21."
