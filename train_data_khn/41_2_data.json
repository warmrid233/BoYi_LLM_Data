In the latter case, both players will then have to choose simultaneously between two distinct moves A and B.\n\nIn the second stage: \n• If every player chooses to play A, 5 euros will be withdrawn from player \n2 ’s initial amount and 15 euros will be added to player 1 ’s initial amount. \nThus player 1 will get 35 euros while player 2 will get 5 euros. \n\n• If every player chooses to play B, 5 euros will be withdrawn from player \n1 ’s initial amount and 25 euros will be added to player 2 ’s initial amount. \nThus player 1 will get 15 euros while player 2 will get 35 euros. \n\n• If the players’ choices are different from each other, then both players’ \namount will be reset to zero (each will thus get 0 euro).\nYour goal is to get as many euros as possible.\n\n"
