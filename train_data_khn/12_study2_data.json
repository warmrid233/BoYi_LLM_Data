At the start, you will be randomly assigned to one of four types: N, W, S, or E. Your type remains fixed for all 30 rounds.\nIn each round, four-person groups are randomly formed, with exactly one participant of each type (N, W, S, E). Group members change randomly every round and are independent of other rounds.\nEach round in a group consists of two stages: first, communication stage, and second, action stage.\nThe communication stage has 2 turns.In each turn, you choose a message (n/w/s/e) (it can signal your intended action later, but you don’t have to follow it). After everyone submits, you’ll see the messages from the other 3 group members (e.g., if you’re type E, you’ll see N, W, and S’s messages).\nThen in action stage, you must select one action from four options: n, w, s, or e (by clicking the corresponding button at the bottom of the screen). You will not know others’ choices during selection.\nEarnings are generated only if all group members choose the same action:\nIf all choose action n: Type-N gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nIf all choose action w: Type-W gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nIf all choose action s: Type-S gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nIf all choose action e: Type-E gets 3 tokens; others get 1 token each.\nOther Cases: If group actions are inconsistent (e.g., some choose n and others w), all participants earn 0 tokens for the round.\nYour goal is to get as many tokens as possible.\n\nYou are designated as type west."
