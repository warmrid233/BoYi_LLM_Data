Each employers set wages for 2 selected employees based on rankings, and employees decide their effort levels according to these wages. The employer’s profit is 32*(effort 1 + effort 2) - wage*2 and the employee’s profit is wage - effort.\nIn the third stage, unemployed participants get 5 ECU and have the option to express dissatisfaction by \"burning\" money, affecting others' earnings.
