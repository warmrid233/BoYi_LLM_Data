<h1> Enter secret code to pick up lost session</h1>
<p> The secret code is used to pick up a session that is lost
because a participant accidentally closed the browser, 
because a computer failed, or because we for some reason
need to move a participant to another work station.</p>

<p> The secret code has 8 characters and is provided by IT 
support - who needs to know the work station number of 
the lost/failed session.</p>
