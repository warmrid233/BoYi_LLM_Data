This is the top directory for the experimental code (written in Python, using
the Django framework) to run the "mmexit" experiment that was eventually
published in the Journal of the European Economic Association as "Face-saving
or fair-minded: What motivates moral behavior?" by Cappelen,  Halvorsen,
Sørensen, and Tungodden. Note that the experiment was run in Norwegian.

To run the experiment, this code relies on a software stack consisting of:

	Python interpreter (Version 2.6 was used at the time of the experiment).

	Django web framework (an older version needed, version 1.1 should work).

	mysql database and MySQLdb for Python.

	Apache webserver with wsgi module enabled.
