choice1	In contract, it is very likely both me and the other participant would choose blue. This has the highest outcome. 	I find the CONTRACT option more confusing so in general I would have picked ONCE. At the beggining I made the decision randomly.	on average more profittable	I believe that the other participant would choose YELLOW if I chose ONCE, then I just received 0 or 20 points. Hovewer, I chose CONTRACT and I would receive 55 points for sure as I selected BLUE	choice was between ONCE and REPEAT. \r\n\r\nI thought it me be wise to choose REPEAT to get a reasonable average.	In Contract you get at least 15 points if the other person chooses Yellow when you have chosen Blue. 	Once seemed easier to understand at first	I wanted to choose blue so i choose contract, because you get at least some points if the other chooses yellow. Besides if the other participant already wanted to choose yellow it is more beneficial to get in the once interaction. 	Contract was the easiest of the choice because choosing blue was the most rewarding option and you could count on the other person to do so as well as it was benificial to collaborate on blue rather than betray with yellow which was not worth it with just 40 points.	100% people choosing once will go for the yellow and end up at 20 for each. and the contract is more understandable because the points it gives is higher than once so I would say almost everyone will choose blue, apart from those who don't understand the contract term	For me it seemed safer to choose for CONTRACT because 'blue' was an optimal option in this interaction. 	I chose contract because the earnings for choosing blue were higher than for yellow so the odds were bigger that the other one chose blue as well	Both me and my participant will earn more if we both choose blue and their has no more earning choices for we to consider, so we prefer to choose CONTRACT.	Contract seemed like a safer choice, I could be more sure the other person would choose blue	I considered the costs of the interaction, rather than the maybe more stable and predictable interaction	Once is more easier to think about.	I chose CONTRACT and ONCE once because I felt like they were both safe options. 	It is less likely to lose points with one of these choices	Contract seems to have more advantages with the extra additional points	In contract, it is more likely to be blue blue
choice2	In repeat, two participants are linked to each other for more than one interaction. Therefore, the other participant is also more likely to choose blue, because of future interactions. This way, I can get the highest outcome for also choosing blue. 	REPEAT is more fun because you don't know how long it will last and it is funnier to interact with the same person multiple fun. If you pick ONCE then you have to wait the others to be finished.	once offers a chance to get a bigger profit, the risk is not that significant	I chose ONCE since I didn't need to spend much time thinking about the decisions I made.	Choice was between ONCE and CONTRACT.\r\nREPEAT in the former experiment didn't work very well, therefore I choose CONTRACT, in the hope we both could earn some	I chose Repeat because in repeat you can lead the other participant into choosing Blue so you can both maximaze the points gained.	I wanted to try Repeat at least once	I choose repeat because I thought it is more beneficial to both choose blue. But in order to both do the same it is easier to have a few rounds with the same person to get the same idea. 	In repeat, the trick was confidance and collaboration, if both of us collaborated on blue, we won 60 points each but if anyone of us choose yellow, that broke the trust of the other person, though you could win 100 points in that round but game was more likely to continue for several more rounds and the next time both of the participants had no choice but to choose yellow as noone could trust the other one now, that in two more rounds the average of the person who choose yellow in the first round comes down to 46.66 which is was only going to deteriorate in further trials. So, it was financially viable option to trust the other person with choosing blue. Whereas with ONCE you can't really rely on other person, the trust cannot be built.	it's the same, almost everyone go for yellow. So I always chose ONCE because I don't want to end up 20-5=15	I chose for repeat because it thought the people that were going to choose for ONCE were probably going for 'yellow' because the interaction wasn't repeated. Besides in REPEAT you could make up if you once had scored 0. 	i chose once because i figured that we'd both go for yellow and in repeat would both choose yellow but more times	ONCE, you don't need to pay for the 5 euro cost and you will at least earn 20 euros if yellow is chose and lucklily 100 if the other choose blue.	Repeat seemed the safer choice	I considered the cost of the interaction	I wanted to try if Repeat could let me earn more money.	Once I chose ONCE because it felt like a safe option but I also chose REPEAT once because I wanted to see what would happen and I could not really loose anything with it.	I chose repeat to higher the chance of gaining points	to not have 5 point deducted	In repeat i had got a chance to play only period 1, so did not choose that option again
choice3	I chose contract, because here is it clear that both participants will choose blue. However, the participant with whom I got to play choose yellow, which I found very odd. 	REPEAT is the most enjoyable option while CONTRACT is confusing to me	contract offers a more certain profit	I chose CONTRACT because it saved time.	REPEAT in a former experiment didn't work very well, therefore I choose CONTRACT, in the hope we both could earn some	Contract gives you the safety that even if the other person doesn't contribute to the benefit of both of the individuals involved and decides only to gain the maximum points regardless of the other person.	I chose Contract because Repeat was not worth the points earned.	I again choose repeat, with the same reasoning as in part 3. It is more likely to get more points than 15 in the repeat stage and i thought it was quite unlikely to both choose blue at the first time. 	CONTRACT was the safest choice as collaborating was the highest paying option whereas in REPEAT some participants can find choosing yellow to be a better choice, so you really can't trust the other person as much as you can in CONTRACT	Contract is better deal	It seemed more safe to choose for CONTRACT because I thought every rational thinking person would choose blue in this interaction. 	i chose contract because we'd both go for blue and in repeat you had to get through a few rounds to get there	CONTRACT, you don't need to worry the other participant will choose yellow because is blue is the best choise for both of us, we both earn 55 euros equally. Fair job and nice play~	Contract was the safer choice	I decided on contract because the distribution of points was a little more equal	I chose CONTRACT because I wanted to know if other participant would make the same choice as me.	I made the choice for REPEAT twice because I was almost 100% certain that the other player would also choose blue and thus will have 60 points. I did REPEAT before this and it took very long so I was not very interested in doing that again since the result would most likely be the same or lower	Because of my previous choices	more additional points	the highest in contract is with blue so both would choose blue
