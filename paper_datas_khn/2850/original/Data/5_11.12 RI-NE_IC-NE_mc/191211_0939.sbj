choice1	The probability of earning points in Repeat is bigger than in Once given the other player collaborates	I felt like the changes for fair outcomes would be higher in once, as I didn't feel like the other participants had a fair behavior. 	As in the experiment ONCE, it's very likely that people may choose YELLOW and I can only get 20 points. However, in the interaction REPEAT, I get higher chance of getting more points and through the REPEAT interaction, I get a chance to observe how other people react to the way I choose and to see if we can cooperate after the result of each step to earn higher points.	Seemed like an option with similar results	In a sequential game such as REPEAT, if one acts rationally, both can obtain the optimal payoffs in several rounds, rather than just waiting for free-riding.	I decided to do ONCE because you cannot be punished for choosing yellow in a future round because it does not exists.	I thought it that it would be more likely for a participant to chose Blue in the first run of REPEAT. This may be either to lure me into choosing Blue as well the next round, or because the other participant realised that if he starts out with choosing yellow, we would likely only earn 20 per round. Since I would not trust him enough anymore to chose Blue. I tried to benefit from that by choosing Yellow the first round, but I am not sure if it was the best strategy, since it meant that we were both earning only 20 points in all of the consequent rounds.	By choosing once there was a greater chance of getting more points 
choice2	I just want to test the Contract interaction. However, I found it weird since I didn't receive at least 15 points when I chose Blue and other player chose Yellow. My point was 0 in Part 3	I did choose contract, as the chances, that both participants would choose blue were high for me. I didn't see much chance for a high outcome of blue, blue in once. 	I chose CONTRACT as it is very likely that the other person would choose BLUE and therefore we can both earn (60-15=) 45 points, which is higher than when I chose ONCE and YELLOW for the experiment.	Seemed like an option with similar results	In CONTRACT game, it is more likely to predict what other might choose as the interests are aligned, indicated by the maximum payoffs for both.\r\nWhile in the ONCE game, the other participant tends to free ride as there would be no punishments or consequences in the later rounds, which were non-exist.	I decided to do ONCE because you can earn more in ONCE compared to the payoffs in CONTRACT.	I thought that anybody would choose Blue for CONTRACT unless you would find it more important that others get less than you than that you earn more. I was wrong once, and still don't understand why anybody would choose Yellow in CONTRACT.	By choosing once there was a chance I would get more points 
choice3	The Repeat interaction is more fun to play and to test the other player. As expected, no one wants to collaborate	Contract has the highest chance for the highest fair outcome for me. So I did choose Contract and hoped for blue, blue.	At first, I choose CONTRACT as I have similar expectation with the previous part, that is the person I interact with will choose BLUE to maximize the point we earn after the experiment. However, I change my decision in the later part to join in the REPEAT interation.	Contract seemed more interesting	The reason to keep choosing the CONTRACT game is the same as above.\r\nIn the REPEAT game, the highest possible payoff is (almost) the same as what one could obtain in the CONTRACT game, which was 45 points. But it was more uncertain when it comes to the REPEAT game as you cannot easily predict what the other might choose.	I chose REPEAT because I figured that the payoffs in that game would be higher than in CONTRACT.	Same reasons as in the answer to the previous question: I thought I would be secure of earning 60 (minus 15) points in CONTRACT. In REPEAT I could earn less.	With repeat I could possibly get more points
