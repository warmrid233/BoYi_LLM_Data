choice1	I chose ONCE because in repeate the earnings are divided by the number of perios carried out and therefore the overall earnings would be less.	Because REPEAT had a cost, it was nearly impossible to get a higher score than the lowest score in ONCE. For example, if I had been lucky and I would have chosen blue all rounds and my partner would have also chosen blue in all rounds of REPEAT, I would still only earn 15 while in ONCE I had the possibility of 20 and 100 if I played it safe by choosing Yellow. This is why I had no difficulty choosing ONCE.	lowest chance to lose earnings	I don't remember what I actually did in Part 2	Most people will choose yellow. In the ONCE game you will earn 20 points but in de REPEAT game you will probably earn about 60-45=15 points. 	Once carried less down side risk because it was associated with no intial cost.	Once you get more points, than gambeling with the choise for repeat	ONCE option provides no possibility to observe what kind of person we're dealing to. And I'm pretty sure that most people would pick yellow instead of blue which lead to 20 points only. Therefore, I chose REPEAT with the thought of maybe I can make a Blue-Blue deal with the person I am paired with.	the earning points. i thimk i will receive more if i choose once after considering the substraction point and possibility 	No costs	I choose ONCE because at REPEAT you were punished with 45 points. I thought it would be hard to earn the same as with ONCE. 	The subtraction of 45 points made me choose ONCE, it also has a better wager, as in, you are likely to earn more points without any subtraction.	repeat didnt seem worth the -45 points	You wouldn't get many more points if you chose repeat, and you risk losing points.
choice2	I chose ONCE because I had a greater possibility of earning 100 points than in CONTRACT.	As I mentioned above as well, CONTRACt also had a cost. If choosing ONCE and Yellow, you could earn 20. While with CONTRACT and the cost, it was very difficult to even earn something instead of losing points, and even if you would earn some points the max would be 15. This is why I did not find it difficult to choose ONCE.	lowest chance to lose earnings	Contract would have been expensive, so I chose ONCE.	With contract the highest outcome would be 60-45=15 points and in ONCE you could get 20. 60 or 100 points. 	Once carried less down side risk because it was associated with no initial cost.	I don't know 	I though that the deduction for CONTRACT (- 45 points) will be made after several pairings. If I knew that it would be deducted for each dealings then I would have chosen ONCE because in the end we can get 20 points at minimum, while in contract the maximum is 15 points.	the susbtraction points counts for contract	No costs	I choose CONTRACT because I thought there was a big chance to get the other person choose for blue	Took a risk by choosing CONTRACT to see how the earnings would be. 	again contract didnt seem worth the -45 points	Losing points in contract.
choice3	I chose CONTRACT in part 4 becasue in REPEAT the earnings are divided by the number of perios carried out and therefore the overall total amount earned would be much less.	Both had a cost, so for me it was choosing the option where I would have the chance of loosing as little as possible. With CONTRACT you only had one chance and it would have been very small. With REPEAT you could try to manipulate the other player to keep choosing Blue, so you would not loose any points. This is why I went for REPEAT, hoping I could work together with the other person to not loose any points.	lowest loss	Repeat ensured maximum minimum income, so I chose it.	With both games you would get -45, and in repeat there is a higher chance that the other player will choice blue in one of the rounds, so the payoff would be higher. 	In contract, down side risk was smaller due to a more fair distribution of earnings. I also felt as though other participants who choose contract are more likely to cooperate than those that choose repeat.	You could earn more by choising contract than repeat	CONTRACT is less risk deal because the deduction is made for both options and I doubt anyone would pick Blue in REPEAT at this stage.	possibility earning points more if i choose repeat rather than contract. because for this part, 45 points will be substracted no matter what choice I make	Repeat gives you the chance to do it more than once	CONTRACT was more safe for me, because I expect people to choose blue there	REPEAT had better wagers, as choice did not matter because 45 points were going to deducted anyway. In REPEAT there is a probability of earning slight better.	i understood reapeat better	Highest chance of earning points in contract, because you would hope people are smart enough to choose blue in that interaction.
