choice2	in contract you' re reassured of gaining points, and it' s more benificial for both players to choose blue so you' d expect that the other player will choose blue too in contract.	CONTRACT implied the subtraction of 15 points while ONCE didn't.	The -15 and the security	More possibilities to earn more money.	If I would choose for contract, 15 points would be substracted at the end. I thougt that therefore I would make more chance to earn more points when I would choose ONCE.	DELETE THIS OBSERVATION	Contract seemed to have more chances to earn more.	I chose ONCE since I don't need to lose 15points from choosing the CONTRACT	I chose ONCE because it did not have the 15 points cost associated with it, so it seemed like the clear choice, and it was simpler to understand its instructions. 	In contract i thought it would be most likely to earn 60-15=45, while in one i thought it would be most likely to earn 20, so 45>20, so that is why is chose contract.
choice1	There' s more chance of participating on the decisions of the other player in repeat.  	REPEAT implied the subtraction of 15 points while ONCE didn't.	The -15 and faith in humanity	More possibilities to earn more money.	REPEAT would lead to 15 points substract, but still it seemed to me that there was more chance to make more points with REPEAT, because there was 75% chance everytime that there was another round and I thought the more rounds I can play, the more points I can earn.	DELETE THIS OBSERVATION	Repeat gave you more chances to play and earn.	I chose ONCE since I don't need to lose 15points from choosing the REPEAT	I again chose ONCE to avoid the 15 points cost, since there was a chance REEAT would've ended after just 1 round so I may have ended with less points because of the cost.	In repeat i thought that the other participant would also choose blue, so then the earning would be higher compared to once, because I assumed that I would earn 20 there. 
choice3	in contract you' re reassured of gaining points, and it' s more benificial for both players to choose blue so you' d expect that the other player will choose blue too in contract.	In CONTRACT there was the security of winning at least 15 point, while in REPEAT you could get even 0.	The security	More possibilities to earn more money.	Both choices would lead to a substraction of 15 points, so then it seemed to me that there was more chance to earn points with REPEAT than with CONTRACT.	DELETE THIS OBSERVATION (Quit from Part 3, computer 25)	Contract seemed more safe way to earn more.	I chose REPEAT since we have more chance of earning more in the next round.	I chose REPEAT because i found the CONTRACT instructions a bit more confusing in the table.	The repeat in part 3 did not turn out how I thought it would be and only costed me money, while contract gave 45, so that is why I chose contract.
