choice1	I chose CONTRACT because if the other participant was so stupid not to see that both choosing ' blue'  would be the way to earn the most money, and thus chose ' yellow'  instead, at least I would earn a bit more than the 0 in ONCE.	it was the simple option in my mind and more straight forward	thhinking the other participant would choose yellow	I chose ONCE, because I would always choose Yellow since that choice garantees that you earn at least something. For ONCE you can earn either 100 or 20, for CONTRACT it is only 40 or 20.
choice2	In ONCE you can earn more money (if the other participant also chooses ' blue'  - and I never understand why they don't) since 5 points will be substracted in you choose REPEAT.	I though the other person will always chose yellow in all the options and it is actually what happened, felt frustrated	Just trying both	I chose ONCE, because (again) I would always choose Yellow. Since you get paired with another participant (even if it is the same participant) after each round, I thought the chance would be more likely that the other participant chooses Blue, which would get me 100 points. If I chose REPEAT, and my participant would stay the same, I thought he/she would not choose Blue after I have chosen Yellow once.
choice3	In CONTRACT there is a more equal way of distributing the money so I hope the other participant will also choose ' blue'. That way you can earn more than if you choose REPEAT and the other participant decides to screw you.	With repeat you could have more interactions and get to know the other participant but it ended up being clear when yellow was the only thing s/he pressed	Not knowing what would be the choice from the other participant	I chose REPEAT, because I took a shot that the other participant would chose Blue sometimes, despite that I would choose Yellow. Sometimes I even chose Blue as I hoped to get 60 points.
