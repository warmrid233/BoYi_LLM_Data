choice1	Did not want to lose points right at the beginning	Once seemed simpler and a safer option	Because in contract I was never not winning some points 	contract seems like a deal that both people choose blue, more profitable for both	The deduction of point.	Contract is safe, I took for granted no one would chose something other than blue and therefore I would get 60 for sure. Choosing Once only makes sense when you take yellow, in this case it is quite unlikely that the other person chooses blue.	I chose contract as it has blue as the dominant strategy for both participants. 	I choose ONCE necause the Nash equilibrium is (Yellow: Yellow) with a payoff for me of 20. The Nash equilibria in Contract are (Blue: Blue) and (Yellow: Yellow), but 5 points will get deducted. So I was not sure how to estimate it because in ONCE I`ll get for sure at least 20, but in CONTRACT I could also only get 10 (15-5) at the end. If I choose the yellow (and the other participant chooses also yellow) I will only end up with 15 points, so it was a bit risky for me and I choose the safer option of ONCE.	I believed that in CONTRACT people had more motivation to choose BLUE, and since this is the pareto optimal outcome, I prefer this. Beat the prisoners dilemma.	I chose once to give it a chance as there wasn't the contract fee	I chose once because it had the chance of making more money. After that I chose contract because I wanted to play more safe and also give money to the other participant. 	In CONTRACT the chance of both participants choosing Blue was very high. The chance that both participants would choose Blue in ONCE would be much lower. It would have been more likely that both participants had chosen Yellow, which means both would earn less.
choice2	Try something else, play more rounds of the game	I havent tried it out yet, the repeat, so I was curious to do so 	For not having my points as an average I also felt it was an easier win win 	repeat just has more sessions so i thought id win more, but at the end is rounded up so you actually dont win more. but it was more fun	Wanted to know if I could earn more points with repeat than with once.	In repeat, people are more likely to cooperate and choose blue because once they have chosen yellow and the experiment continues, the other person is likely never going to chose blue again, therefore earnings will likely be equal or smaller than 60.	I chose ONCE as I wanted to see how the other participant would react to this prisoners dilemma instead of the repeated game theory.	I choose ONCE because the Nash equilibrium is in both games the same but when I always choose yellow as well as the other participant we get on average in the REPEAT game always 15 and in the ONCE game I get for sure at least 20. So I choose the less riskier version, and took ONCE. 	CONTRACT for same reason as part 2.	I chose once for a different opportunity	I found repeat complicated and more risky of losing money because your participant can trick you by choosing blue in the first round and then you think you have to choose blue in the second round and then they choose yellow the second round. 	For ONCE I had a larger chance of getting 100 points than in the REPEAT mode. 
choice3	Enjoyed choosing REPEAT in part 3	Contract seemed like a safer option	Contract is easier for having a better idea of what the other participant may choose 	contract seems like a deal that both people choose blue, more profitable for both	The most save option with the highest reward for both of the players	Contract is safe, risk for repeat would have been to big and earnings possibly lower.	I chose contract as it has blue as the dominant strategy for both participants. 	I choose CONTRACT because there are two Nash equilibria and (Blue: Blue) has the higher payoff even compared to REPEAT, where the Nash equilibria is (Yellow: Yellow), and there is only a 75% chance that the game will get in the next stage. I think in Part 4 CONTRACT is the better choice, if one wants to have a higher chance of higher payoffs.	Person did not choose BLUE in contract, even though that person made a loss, irational, so chose REPEAT now = More fun.	I chose contract because I got stuck in 7 rounds of repeat and didn't want to continue it. Also because there a point deduction either way	Contract because you can be quite sure you make 60 points and repeat is more complicated. I also don't like playing over the other participants by choosing yellow in repeat and making 100. and giving them 0. 	In CONTRACT the chance that both participants chose blue was very high. In REPEAT that chance of both participants choosing blue was lower.
