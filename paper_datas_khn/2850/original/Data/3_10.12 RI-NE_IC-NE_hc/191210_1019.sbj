choice1	low cognitive load	I wanted to be sure that i dont loose points	I chose once because of the subtraction as repeat doesn't guarantee more earnings to compensate	Due to the costs	By choosing ONCE, I expected to earn the most points, because of the 45 point deduction in choosing repeat.	I chose ONCE because due to the substraction of 45 points when choosing REPEAT, it was simply not worth it.	Once seemed to me less risky.	I figured that ONCE would be the safest because no points would be subtracted.	Trust that the other person would choose an option that would benefit you equally	It made sense to choose ONCE in round one as otherwise you would have had an automatic 45 points subtracted. REPEAT was also a less favourable choice to make as due to the concept of the prisoners dilemma, it is likely that people will end up choosing yellow over blue at some point, meaning your payoff has a higher chance to be lower than in ONCE, if both participants chose blue in the first instant (my opinion)	Als er 45 punten vanaf gaan, is je enige kans om meer te verdienen dan het laagste bij ONCE door op safe te spelen (20), dan moet je dus een gemiddelde van 65+ halen om meer punten te verdienen. Dit kan je alleen doen door minstens een keer 100 punten ta halen. Wat je alleen maar kan doen door geel te kiezen en de ander blauw, alleen is deze optie erg laag. Daardoor kan je beter veilig voor ONCE kiezen en zeker 20 punten krijgen	I figured there was a low chance that the average earnings of REPEAT - 45 points would be higher than the points collected in ONCE.	chossing ONCE was less risky as when you make a choice of REPEAT 45 points are substrccted and there is a chance you'll have only one round 	I understood how ONCE worked better	Because in repeat you had the chance to get more repeats in a row which would be more lucerative	I always chose ONCE, because it was a matter of chance: the fist time i won 100 points, so I tried to keep on using my strategy
choice2	low cognitive load	the earnings where higher in once because there were no points extracted	Once because there are incurred costs to contract	Due to the costs	By choosing ONCE, I expected to earn the most points, because of the 45 point deduction in choosing contract.	I chose ONCE because the possible earnings of choosing CONTRACT were too little due to the substraction of 45 points.	The same reason as above. less risky. That made me choose for ONCE	Again, I figured ONCE would be the safest because no points would be subtracted.	Hoping that the other person would eventually choose blue to benefit me	I chose to do ONCE, as i do not believe it was worth the chance to choose CONTRACt as you would have an automatic 45 points deducted and it would have been unlikely to receive an average of 60 in this case, making the payoff quite low 	Als er 45 punten vanaf gaan, is je enige kans om meer te verdienen dan het laagste bij ONCE door op safe te spelen (20), dan moet je dus een gemiddelde van 65+ halen om meer punten te verdienen. Dit is niet eens mogelijk, waardoor het heel onlogisch is om CONTRACT te kiezen. Daardoor kan je beter gewoon ONCE kiezen en zeker 20 punten krijgen	The 45 points deduction meant the maximum amount you could earn in CONTRACT was 15, while in ONCE you could earn 60, 100 or 0, which is why I preferred ONCE.	I chose ONCE because you can make more money in this interaction 	Choosing CONTRACT would subtract part of my points	Same reason to choose repeat, its more lucerative	Once again, there was a higher rate of succes for ONCE, and the 45 minus points you recieved for CONTRACT made me back off
choice3	curious, lets-take-a-risk feeling	I choose contract because it was the savest option that delivers the most points	Repeat because higher chance of interaction. But should have chosen contract.	The other player was more likely to choose blue, which would lead to a better outcome. Only if the other player had chosen blue and I yellow under repeat would I not have made losses.	Both of these interactions had a 45 point deduction, but when choosing contract it was almost guaranteed that the other player would choose BLUE, as doing so for both participants lead to the only profitable scenario. So for me it meant that choosing CONTRACT leads to an interaction where there is almost no chance ending up with negative points.	I chose CONTRACT to not have a risk of losing points, which would have been possible when choosing REPEAT.	I choose CONTRACT because I wanted  to try if this is more rendabel	I chose REPEAT because I thought I would earn more from that when choosing BLUE every time, but because the other participant chose yellow every time that did not happen.	Trust that the other person would choose an option that would benefit you equally	I chose to play REPEAT and Contract once each, as either way there was a reduction of 45 points meaning that these would be low point rounds, since by now, due to the logistics of the prisoners dilemma, most participants would be choosing yellow anyways meaning we would most likely end up with negative points 	Als er 45 punten vanaf gaan, kan je bij REPEAT vrij lastig meer punten verdienen. Bij CONTRACT is de kans groter dat de ander ook voor blauw gaat, omdat hier het meeste winst te behalen valt.\r\nStel de ander kiest blauw, heb jij de keuze tussen blauw (60 punten) of geel (40 punten)\r\nEn als de ander voor geel kiest, heb jij de keuze tussen blauw (15 punten) of geel (20 punten)\r\nEr is heel heel klein verschil om dan ook voor geel te gaan, maar dit verschil is zo minimaal, dat het niet echt uit maakt.\r\nDaarom is de kans groot dat beide blauw kiezen, en zo 60-45=15 punten te krijgen	I figured that the average points earned in REPEAT could very well be negative or 0 while CONTRACT gives you a certain income of 15 in this case.	I was choosing REPEAT  because there was a higher chance of bigger earnings 	CONTRACT seemed to guarantee more secure earnings	Just choosing contract because in part 3 I already choose it a lot	Contract, it was clear what the other person would choose (blue), because that was the highest number of points to win
