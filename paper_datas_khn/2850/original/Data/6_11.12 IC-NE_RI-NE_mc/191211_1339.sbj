choice2	With contract it seemed more likely to lose points. While in ONCE there was a 50% chance you will gain some points.	You can earn more in once.	I chose once because I felt like I could more accurately guess what the other actor would do. It felt more secure that way.	the chances of a higher pay-out seemed higher to me in ONCE	I chose CONTRACT, because you are pretty sure that you will get 45 points. In ONCE, it is likely you will only get 20 points.	In Contract there is only 1 good option, I believed it will be a win win for everyone for sure	minmax rule 	I liked the idea of contract more than ONCE even though 15 would be deducted from my earnings.	For ONCE I had the expectation that the other person would go for Yellow, I would also go for Yellow and we would both end up with 20. Where I expected that for Contract we both would select Blue, and even with the substraction of 15 points, both earning 45 is better than 20. Therefore I choose for Contract. 	I decided to choose Contract becasue I believed it would guarantee me 60 points as Blue was rational choice for everypne in Contract.	i prefered not losing 15 points	Contract has a bigger chance for bigger earnings through \" cooperating\" 	In Part 2 I thought I and the other participant can make more money if we play contract	I sticked to ONCE most of the time because it there wasn' t a \"penalty\" to be paid for making the choice	CONTRACT had a higher chance of getting a 60-60 spread, since choosing yellow was lucrative. I try to get stable earnings of points in these experiments, so choosing CONTRACT was the most logical option.	contract was too complicated to make a choice
choice1	Repeat seemed more of an opportunity to let the other participant know that if we both chose BLUE then we have more chance to gain equal points. This is in place of one gaining and the other not gaining at all.	I chose repeat because it was more fun to play that one.	I chose once again because I felt like I could more accurately guess what the other actor would do. Also I felt that the chance of getting more did not weigh up to the price of 15 points that had to be paid.	the chances of a higher pay-out seemed higher to me in ONCE, noting the average that would be taken and the subtraction	First, I chose ONCE. In ONCE I thought there was more chance of getting 60 or 100 points in my opinion. In REPEAT, I thought I wouldn't earn more than 45 points. But I also wanted to try REPEAT, so second I chose REPEAT. 	Repeat because it seemed more interesting	minmax rule	I found that with REPEAT you would get more chances	Repeat seemed harder since I was not sure how many times I had to play against that person. I myself wanted to go for yellow and if you select yellow in the first round, then it is very likely that the other person doesnot trust you anymore and will go for yellow after round one. The once game was in my opinion a better option, since you did not had to take the minus 15 points into your calculations. 	I chose Repeat because it has more transparency so people tend to choose blue instead of yellow.	i did not want to risk having negative points	Repeat has lower risk of earning nothing or very little	I didn't really understand the difference between part 2 and 3, so I randomly choose something	I chose ONCE because there was no fine to be paid for playing the mode	ONCE would probably have turned out yellow and REPEAT gave me the chance of getting a higher yield. 	repeat was more likely to make me earn more money
choice3	REPEAT for the same reason, even though you lose out on 15 points it still has a higher likelihood of both participants working together to gain the most equally than losing points equally.	I chose repeat because it was more fun to play that one.	I chose for contract because I did not like the chance factor in repeat and instead felt like I was sure the outcome would be blue;blue in contract	I felt that with repeat there might be a mutual understanding for choosing blue which in my mind would result in a higher pay-out. With contract the pay-out in itself seemed lower to me	I chose CONTRACT. You are sure of what you will get. 	Same reason as with part 2	I assumed that cooperation is more likely in CONTRACT, so I expected higher payoff.	I chose REPEAT as I found that with REPEAT you could build a system of understanding with your partner and it could work in everybodys favour as you are likely to have multiple chances.	For contract I felt most sure about ending up in the blue blue situation, where for repeat there is more insecurity about the outcomes and about the amount of rounds. 	I chose Contract ( as I belived it would ensure 60 points)	choosing cntract meant that at worst i would gain or lose zero	Contract has a bigger chance for bigger earnings through \" cooperating\" 	I choose contract because I thought we both could make more money there	I chose repeat because it was the one mode i hadn't filled in before, it was more a choice of \"switching things up\" then a choice of making more profit	I expected CONTRACT its yield to be higher since there were higher incentives for getting a 60-60 spread. REPEAT came with the danger that you would get 0 or only 20 while still getting a 15 penalty. 	repeat was more likely to make me earn more money
