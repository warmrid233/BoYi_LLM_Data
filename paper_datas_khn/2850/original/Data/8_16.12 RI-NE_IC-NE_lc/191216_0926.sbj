choice1	In ONCE, you had to hope for the other persno to choose blue as well, while in REPEAT, even if the other choose yellow, you could still earn something in the next round, hoping for blue of the other person.	I chose once because if I chose yellow, I'd get the highest possible earnings, which I did one of the times as the other person chose blue.	Repeat averages out any losses I would have made, had the other participant chosen yellow.	once, easier	i believed that with repeat, the chance of someone picking yellow to be much higher, hence i picked once\r\n	If you can take the decision the other person made in the first round in to account, the second time you can take a more informed decision. So the little bit of extra knowledge that you get from doing multiple rounds instead of just one interaction can help you get more earnings.	I thought with Repeat you could have some sense of \"information exchange\" or coming to a concensus.	I first chose REPEAT, hoping it would get me more points, as I believed it was more probable that we both chose Blue multiple times. However, we only interacted once (and I ended up losing the 5 points as well), so then I went to try ONCE.	Selecting Yellow in REPEAT was a sensible gamble, as you gained either way the random number selector operated. 	Have more chances of earning more points.	the chance of playing more rounds	Repeat seemed to offer the prospect of more rounds to make earnings. Also this play form allowed for an exchange of feedback, possible resulting in rational behavior that optimizes gains for both parties. 
choice2	In ONCE it felt more likely to get \" screwed over\", since the rate to choose yellow and the other one blue, was a 100, while in CONTRACT, you got \"punished\" if you choose yellow, and having blue would give both persons most points. That is why I choose CONTRACT, but sadly ended up in ONCE.	I chose contract because you can get high earnings if both choose blue. If both choose yellow in once, the earnings are much less.	Contract doesn't have as harsh a loss if the other participant chose yellow and I blue. There is no incentive to choose yellow.	Contract is garanteed 55 where as once is risky 	i blieved that in contract individuals would pick blue, so i picked contract 	I thought that in contract, people are most likely to choose blue. For me personally I would love it if everyone always chose blue, and in Contract the chances of the other person choosing blue were a little higher	I realised that in ONCE, other participants would choose for Yellow (while actually choosing blue both would be more profitable for both). I realised that for Contract, choosing Blue would be more profitable for everyone in any case.	I chose both; CONTRAT because I wanted to ensure some points (I believed it was highly probable that we both chose Blue), and then I chose ONCE, wanting to take the risk, so as to earn the 100 points.	The possibility of marginal gain was better for ONCE than for CONTRACT.\r\nThe premise behind ONCE was simpler, so this also guided my choice. 	easiest and less money retracted	i chose contract because in this case even if I chose blue ( to try to earn more) and the other player chose Yellow (because of risk aversion for example) I ended up with 15 euro, which is better than 0. Hence Contract in this case always give the possibility to earn money	I figured that if the ONCE game form consisted of multiple rounds, each round would offer an independent chance to maximize profit, not reliant upon earlier decisions or the trust of other participants. 
choice3	Both costs 5 points and in CONTRACT choosing blue would benefit both persons the most. 	I chose contract because the earnings would be higher if both chose blue than an average of periods in repeat.	With contract, there is one best choice for both participants, so averaging out any losses would be unneccessary.	contract you know you get 55, repeat is risky 	similar reasoning to the statement above	Again, I felt like the chances of the other person choosing blue were highest in contract. Knowing this, I could also choose blue with less risk than in Repeat	In Part 2 I realised that interacting in Repeat did not lead to a concensus; other participants were still just choosing for Yellow. So, as in Contract blue was the most profitable, I chose blue.	Once again I chose each one once. I first chose REPEAT, hoping it would get me more points, as I believed it was more probable that we both chose Blue multiple times. However, the other participant chose Yellow after the first Period, so I ended up regretting the decision. I, then, chose CONTRAT as a safer option.	REPEAT was worth the gamble because a cost was attributed to either decision, so it made sense to choose the option that might give several opportunities to accumulate points. 	More chances to get more money	the reason is the same of Part 3.	Repeat seemed to offer the benefit that if my fellow participant would not choose blue in the first round, but would in the second round, then my loss would be evened out by the other gain.
