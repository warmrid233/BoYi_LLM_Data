choice2	Chose once because I did not want 45 points to be subtracted if I had chosen contract.	I chose ONCE because I didnt have to pay for it and therefore could earn more points.	I chose ONCE, because 45 points would be subtracted from my points in that stage if I chose CONTRACT. The maximum earning if I chose CONTRACT were 60. Minus 45 that would be 15. I figured that if I chose ONCE and then YELLOW, I would earn at least 20 points (which is more than 15). In practice, I chose  ONCE and then BLUE, because I think that's fair, but I ended up with points two times...	Just to be on the safe side. So I chose Once.	Maximizing own profit via ONCE, I was not sure enough to select CONTRACT to get a blue-blue result. 	I chose ONCE, as the profits for ONCE were higher, due to the subtraction of 45 in CONTRACT	45 points minus	For CONTRACT you would have deducted 45 points. and realistically I would have earned less than that plus the minimum 20 points (so together 65) that I could get by selecting yellow in ONCE.	I chose ONCE, to have save earnings	I chose ONCE because I didn't want to incur the 45 point cost of choosing CONTRACT.	non-altruism - once	I chose once because I did not want to have 45 points deducted from my earnings.	ONCE made more sense to me and seemed fairer	The financial penalty dissuaded me from choosing Contract	Chose once to not pay the 45	I believe I chose contract. Because in this condition there is no risk of getting 0 points. (However, I regretted this after realizing 45 points are subtracted)	In ONCE you had more chance of earning more points than in CONTRACT, because in CONTRACT there was a cost of 45 points.	I choose CONTRACT because both can earn the same among of money	Because of the subtraction of 45 points, your payoff will always be highest if you choose yellow in the ONCE interaction.	If I chose Yellow at ONCE I was guaranteed an earning of 20 while the maximum earnings at CONTRACT were 15 due to the costs.
choice1	Repeat is more exciting	I chose ONCE because I didnt have to pay for it and could make the same amount of points on average. but since you had to pay, i thought i would earn more in ONCE (I thought people would be more likely to chose blue all the time...)	I chose ONCE once again (haha) because of the subtraction of 45 points if I chose REPEAT, if my calculations are correct I could earn more in ONCE than in REPEAT (see above, same as CONTRACT). I chose yellow two times because I had lost faith in humanity at this point.	Again I chose ONCE cause I didn't want to lose subtracted points.	Same is above, maximizing and i was not sure enough to place a ' trusting bet'.	I chose ONCE, as the profits of ONCE were higher, due to the high subtraction in REPEAT	45 points minus	For REPEAT you would have deducted 45 points. and realistically I would have earned less than that plus the minimum 20 points (so together 65) that I could get by selecting yellow in ONCE.	i chose repeat to enhance my earnings	I chose ONCE because I didn't want to incur the 45 point cost of choosing REPEAT.	try something new - repeat	I chose once (again) to avoid having 45 points deducted from my payment.	REPEAT was more of an interesting outcome and did not have any losses	Repeat gave me more chances to get a higher score	Chose once to not pay the 45	I chose once, because in repeat you would get the average and 45 points are subtracted. If you choose yellow in once, there are less consequences.	In ONCE you had more chance of earning more points than in REPEAT, because in REPEAT there was a cost of 45 points.	I choose ONCE because in REPEAT you lost 45 points	Because of the subtraction of 45 points, your payoff will always be highest if you choose yellow in the ONCE interaction.	At ONCE I was guaranteed an earning of 20 while at REPEAT I was unsure about my earnings and if we were to follow the Nash equilibrium and both choose yellow, my earnings would have been much lower
choice3	Repeat gives you the feeling you get more chances to change something	I chose CONTRACT because I thought that it is likely people chose blue (which is the highest amount of points in this part) and therfore both earn the same amount of points. therfore less risky then REPEAT	I chose CONTRACT, because the subtracting would happen anyway and I figured that people would see that if you chose BLUE in CONTRACT, you could earn the maximum points in CONTRACT (people weren't)	Contract seemed more safe and I lost less points.	I figured i could maximise by getting a contract, but i forgot about the -45 deduction. Got a blue-blue result, but figured that the cost could've been relatively less in a REPEAT setting. Though, only with a BLUE partner. I'm not sure if i made the right decision to go for CONTRACT as the result only was a meager 15 points	I chose REPEAT, as I believed the chance of both choosing blue would be higher because you now have a chance at playing more than 1 round with someone. This would result in a higher final profit than for REPEAT, where you only play 1 round with someone else	More likely my partner is gonna choose blue, thus more earnings	I selected CONTRACT because there it was clear that blue would benefit us both, so an almost guaranteed 15 (60-45) points could be expected opposed to the most realistic (both of us choose yellows) -25 (20-45) at REPEAT.	i chose contract to make save earnings 	At first I chose REPEAT because I thought it would maximize my chances of accumulating points but then I chose CONTRACT because I earned a very low amount of points playing REPEAT.	repeat - chance of earning is higher as it has more rounds	I chose repeat in this period since I was interested to see how it would play out, and whether the other participant would change their decisions based on my choices.	REPEAT seemed a more reliable choice	Repeat carried less financial penalty	Contract as both parties would be able to make points	I chose contract, because this condition would bring up the most points, if both chose 60 (which is likely, because 45 points are subtracted, so 60;60 would be the best choice in part 4 I believe).	In REPEAT you had a chance of earning more points than in CONTRACT, because there's a chance of earning 100 points per period. 	I choose CONTRACT because we can earn more points	I chose for REPEAT, hoping for the other to choose blue, so that I would gain 100 (which happened).	The chance that someone chooses blue at CONTRACT is very high and I probably won't get any higher earnings than 60 if I played REPEAT
