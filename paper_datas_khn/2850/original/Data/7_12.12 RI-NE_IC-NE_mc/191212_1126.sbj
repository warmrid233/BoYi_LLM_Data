choice1	I was hoping people would choose blue en therefore have the most equal pay for both. If this was the case, ONCE would be more profitable. Alas, people seemed quite self-centered.	Once, because you could not lose any points.	Repeat is better, it has more chance to make an average of 60 payoff because you can work together	ramdom	I choose  ONCE to have an instant and safe gain	I did not want to be penalized with -15 points.	I choose ONCE because I had fewer risks to loose points	To see how people react in different situations and under different motivations	Better chance of both choosing blue over several rounds.	For ONCE there were no costs
choice2	Seeing how people got punished I figured they would be more likely to choose the more equal one, so blue. Therefore it would be more profitable to both pick blue and get more point than with yellow. Since people in ONCE appeared to pick yellow pretty consistantly this seemed the more safe choice.	Once, because you could not lose points. Contract because I thought everyone would pick Blue.	Contract is the better option, almost guaranteed payoff of 60 (minus 15) if the other party is not stupid. ONCE gives 20 because yellow is the logical option.	ramdom	I choose CONTRACT to try a new choice	Again, I went with the choice with which I would not lose 15 points.	I choose ONCE because I had fewer risks to loose points. I was sure to earn at least few points.	To see how people react in different situations and under different motivations	Less likelyhood of the other person choosing yellow in contract. Obviously I was wrong and the other person is either a moron or a sociopath.	For ONCE there were no costs
choice3	I chose contract because of the reasons mentioned before. I didn't particularely like the repeat option since you still had a pretty good chance people would choose yellow anyway.	Repeat, because you could just put Yellow and earn at least 20 points on every round.	Contract is the better option, almost guaranteed payoff of 60 (minus 15). Repeat you can get mistreated if after working together for blue/blue the other party decides to go yellow	ramdom	I chose different ccomand to try everything	I saw I would maximize my points if I chose CONTRACT over REPEAT.	I choose REPEAT because I had fewer risks to loose points	To see how people react in different situations and under different motivations	Contract because I thought the other person would never choose yellow. Repeat after since the other person did inexplicably choose yellow.	I thought I would make more money in REPEAT
