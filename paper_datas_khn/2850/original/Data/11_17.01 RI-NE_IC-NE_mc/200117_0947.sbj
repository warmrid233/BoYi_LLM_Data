choice1	I chose REPEAT because there would be more opportunity to get more points. In ONCE you only get one chance, and you'll most likely make 20 or 0. 	the costs	With repeat you have the chance to earn more.	To be honest i wanted to play around and see what the results would be so i took a chance. At this point it seemed more advantageous to play around.	I choose the simple one	I was earning money for sure 	I chose ONCE mostly because of the chances of earning more money. 	I want to finish the game as soon as possible, and I don't need to make decision depending on the previous results I have. I only need to think once to choose the color. 	ONCE could save time. And it is more likely to be win-to-win. 	Free cost and medium chance to profit	I didn't want to lose any money so chose the safest option, which was ONCE.	not worth it playing the additional rounds.
choice2	I chose ONCe (I think), because there would be a chance of getting 100 points. 	again the costs	With Once you have the chance to earn more.	After experiencing Repeat the idea of contract seemed to be a more sure bet to gain with not much loss and also have the other participant gain too, if they saw they same patterns i did. Whereas once was a safe option but odds were in favour of contract.	I dont like Contract to complicated	I was earning money for sure 	I chose ONCE mostly because of the chances of earning more money, considering the 15 points of discount.	The uncertainty of result is much higher compared to CONTRACT. I believe most people would choose BLUE in CONTRACT, and I can get 45 points even if it cost me 15 points. However, in ONCE, the chance of YELLOW of the paired participants is 50/50, and it would be safer to choose YELLOW in ONCE. The possibility of getting only 20 points is really high, and which is much less than the result of CONTRACT even if it doesn't cost me at all.	ONCE could save time. And it is more likely to be win-to-win.	Free cost and medium chance to profit	I didn't want to lose any money so chose the safest option, which was ONCE.	contract always increases overall welfare. Players and incentivized to play BLUE.
choice3	I chose CONTRACT, because I thought it would be certain I'd get 45 points instead of likely less if I chose REPEAT.	you play more times with repeat so i choose that for start. No other reason i guess	With repeat you have the chance to earn more.	Observation was that the person likely saw that it is a safer and more likely way for both individuals to gain rather than battle over spoils as repeat has no gurantee of high earning due to the random number drawn by the algorythm therefore the fact that what you earn is what you keep from contract, no algorythm making decisions for you and logical deduction lead me to my choice.	Contract is just to complicated	I studied how i would earn more money, or at least, money for sure 	If chose REPEAT because i wanted to see how the other partcipants interact having the chance to see your decision. In this stage i earn less money considering the decisions that we made, so my theory of chosing ONCE in the previous stages was right i think.	I believe that the result of REPEAT and CONTRACT would be the same, and I don't want to waste more time to get the same result. 	ONCE could save time. And it is more likely to be win-to-win.	CONTRACT for me was the most clear way to choose blue for me and the other participant	I chose the option that would allow me to maximise my income the most, which was CONTRACT.	Same reason as in the previous question.
