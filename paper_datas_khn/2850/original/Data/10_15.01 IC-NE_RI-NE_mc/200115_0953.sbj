choice2	I chose once over contract because I was insured at least 20 points in ONCE.	It is likely that the person would choose yellow in all experiments, so the earning of yellow&yellow is the same. Then 20 is guarantee without any deduction.	It's more likely to end up with zero in ONCE , because of my belief that since contract is less risky and less marginal benefit people would choose blue.	No particular reasons 	CONTRACT very strongly incentivises cooperation (blue), even when participation cost is taken into account. ONCE incentivises not only a more risky approach, but not sharing (yellow) as well, as choosing blue risks earning you nothing, whereas yellow always earns you something.	Once did not have any costs.	Contract as safe choice to gain the maximum for both (if the other actually is aware of that)	Contract. Because if the other person has knowingly chosen Contract that means he knows blue is the best bet to get more points. And we both would want to choose blue to get points for each other.	Contract, to see if i was able to make more decisions.	I chose ONCE because I thought it is the most efficient if both of us choose BLUE right away. Unfortunately I was too trustful and the other participant chose twice YELLOW.	I chose once because it was possible the other participant would choose blue and I would chose yellow even if there was less money involved.	I am not sure what I chose 
choice1	Likewise, the lowest amount of points I could earn in ONCE by choosing yellow was 20, but it was not true if I had chosen REPEAT	I chose once because in scenario of 4times yellow&yellow, the earning would be 20-15=5. Whereas once is 20 minimum if you chose yellow	Repeat adds additional data for the next decision making period,since there is a possibility of a \"next round\" that's highly possible.	People in ONCE are very likely to choose \" yellow\" , so I chose REPEAT	I first chose ONCE to see if my prediction that a randomly chosen other participant would opt for yellow. In phase 2 I chose REPEAT to see if I could incentivise my opponent to default to blue by matching their previous choice, but realised very quickly this was not going to happen, as choosing blue carries a higher risk for loss and lower risk for reward.	With repeat it was more likely the other one would choose Blue, because there was a big chance you would see each other again. And both taking Blue results in a higher outcome than chosing Yellow.	I do not remember which choice I made.	I chose Repeat because in ONCE most people choose Yellow to be safe and get 20 points. Repeat has a good chance playing with the opponent to make sure we both get points by either going for blues or getting a lucky 100 with yellow. 	Repeat , to get more participation.	I chose REPEAT because I thought we could earn both the most money if we both choose BLUE several times, so it can be more profitable than ONCE. Unfortunately the other participant chose YELLOW after two times BLUE.	I chose REPEAT because again yellow was slow but steady way to earn some money.	Repeat had more social control, because you (probably) had to play another round together
choice3	I thought the other participant would most likely choose Blue in contract which would result in 60 points for each	If I chose contract in case yellow&yellow, the return is 15-15=0. Whereas if i chose repeat the worst case scenario of chosing yellow each time will make you 5. (20x4/4) - 15 = 5. Maybe you are withdrawn ealier so earning are higher, and there is a bigger possibility that the other participant would chose blue and i earn 100 over 4 times  	In either case , 15 points would be subtracted so in repeat I have the chance to adjust my game according to my pair's decisions is more likely	People in CONTRACT are more likely to choose \"blue\" 	I chose CONTRACT in accordance with my previous choice explanations: as REPEAT incentivises a choice for yellow, this would lead to smaller returns in earnings, as one could expect an outcome of yellow-yellow every time. CONTRACT, however, incentivises blue-blue, which would more consistently lead to a slightly higher return.	Because both had costs I only focused on the normal earnings. And with contract you are forced to choose Blue, because that has the highest outcome, and the only reason to choose Yellow is if you want a higher outcome than the other person. The chance of getting a higher outcome was bigger if you choose for contract than for repeat.	I had realized that the others in contract mostly did not choose blue, which made the gains very small for myself. So I decided to switch the method in order to gain more.	Contract has a sure shot way of earning 45 points if the other person has understood it well. 	I chose both I think. I just wanted to be able to participate in both and see if there was any difference with the reactions of other participants.	I chose REPEAT because I thought it is more profitable than CONTRACT if both chose BLUE several times. However the other participant went for YELLOW	I chose CONTRACT because I thought this time it is a possibility that other participant might chose blue	It felt safer to choose contract, if you would make the decision to pick blue and the other one would pick yellow. You would have 15 point - 15 = 0. In repeat you could get kicked out if you picked blue en the other one yellow, you would have 0 points - 15 = -15 points.
