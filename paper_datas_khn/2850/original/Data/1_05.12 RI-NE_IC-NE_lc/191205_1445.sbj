choice1	Repeat can increase the possibility that more points will be made	beacuse has no influence	I chose repeat, hoping the other would choose Blue, which is more likely under repeat, as there is some room for cooperation/punishment. Then I'd choose yellow and hope for a quick end of the game to keep the average pay-out high.	one shot game more effective if you are lucky	this that people could improve they score, altruism ever heard of that capitalist\r\n?	once was a safe choice in comparison to repeat	chance of earnings	The chances of someone choosing yellow by ONCE were slim.	I CHOSE REPEAT BECAUSE I FELT I MAY EARN MORE AS AS IT KEEPS RPEATING, RATHER THAN HAVING AN EARNING ONCE WHICH MAY NOT BE FAVOURABLE.	I thought that decision once is more reliable than repeat and possible outcome under the best circumstance is more higher than repeat. Also computers decision on period number selection is random, that makes outcome unforseen. Although it takes courage to make this decision 'once' and blue selection because from this path of decision you may obtain nothing but I like to share and to trust good and generous people not greedy or winner takes all in ones. 	On the one hand, with once there is a chance to be matched with someone that will simply choose blue. On the other hand, repeat gives the incentive to cheat from the second period and would minimise your earnings. So I went with ONCE	In my opinion the Repeat interaction was to risky and the others were too aggressive in choosing	Best option	No points deduction	i took into account the 5 point that were taken and given the fact that i thought everytime everyone would choose yellow, it made more sense to choose the option ONCE	Random	I choose once because I expected that the benefit would be highest then.	I chose repeat to get more shots at earning points.	repeat gives me the opportunity to check what the other person's strategy is. \r\nAlso its a bit more fun	I did the math and was the same money as everypne would select yellow anyway (and mo 5 minus)	There wasn't a difference in a good strategy between ONCE and REPEAT. It makes more sense to do ONCE, because the average might be lower than 100 ( highest possible payout). I also tried repeat chose BLUE and it rolled 4, so I felt that repeat was a scam. 	I thought I could have received a 100 at least in one round and then my end payoff would be high
choice2	Same as first question I choose contract, choosing ONCE will take higher change of less point	contract makes more likeley for pepopoe to choose blue	I chose contract as (60,60) is clearly a nash equilibrium, while for once that would be (20,20) which is lower, obviously.	contract is a safe 60 of profit as its nash equilibrium	contract- biggest outcome splitted equaly among people. How it should be, perfectly balanced communism	in once there is a possibility of getting 0 but contrast you never get 0 points	chance of earnings	The chances of someone choosing yellow by ONCE were slim, there was no point in loosing 5 points for nothing.	I CHOSE ONCE BECAUSE I DID NOT LIKE THE OUTCOME OF REPEAT WHICH I PREVIOUSLY DID AND SO I WANTED TO TRY THIS ANYWAY AND ALSO I WONT BE ABLE TO EARN 100 IN CONTRACT AT ALL	I thought that decision once is more reliable than contract and possible outcome under the best circumstance 'blue-blue' is more higher than contract.	Contract increased the likeliness of BLUE by reducing the immense payout of YELLOW, so I chose contract, even if it cost 5 points, I would have expected to earn 30 points in ONCE anyways	Once was the safest decision for the same reason	Best option	No points deduction	Same reason as what i stated above, it would cost me more than it would give me	More likelihood that someone chooses blue	I choose contract because I expected the benefits to be highest then.	I chose contract because even though 5 points were deducted, the worst outcome was better than in once.	contract is less risk. i choose to trust a person before knowing them so I personally will always start with blue. in this way, contract gives the same reward and less risk	the same as above	I felt that CONTRACT had more of a chance that the other person would choose BLUE, because their was less risk with choosing blue. So I was more likely to get hte (60,60) payout, which is better than (20,20).	In CONTRACT there's a high chance that I end up with a higher payoff than I would do in ONCE
choice3	I choose repeat once and then contract, because in both case choosing same is always same points, while I would like to take a risk to see how other choose	contract makes more likely for pepople to coose blue	I chose contract as the likely payoff is 60-5=55, while for repeat there is a large probability that payoff will be lower, as each player has an incentive to deviate from blue to yellow, which will probably lead to a yellow,yellow equilibrium at some point, which is especially harmful if the game is played several rounds.	same as anwser above	same as up	Less gambling by choosing contract	chance of earnings	I choose contract because the chance of someone choosing yellow was very slim, because they would earn more if the chose blue.	I CHOSE REPEAT BECAUSE I DONT THINK CONTRACT WILL BE FAVOURABLE ENOUGH. ACTUALLY I THINK CONTRACT IS RISKY BUT IM NOT SURE.	Since both of them has the same outcome it does not effect my decision. 	Repeat gives incentives to cheat, contract reduces the incentive (but doesn't eliminate it)	I preferred contract because repeat was too risky for me	Best option	Random	repeat would give me more just in case somebody did decide to press blue	Contract because of more likelihood that someone chooses blue	I choose contract oce again bcause I thought the outcome would be most favourable.	I chose contract because I realised that it gave more chances to earn points than repeat, since in repeat all results are then averaged out.	because i was betrayed in the first time playing repeat. and realized that if i get betrayed agian, i will lose trust in humanity. possibly punch somebody	the same as above	I chose CONTRACT, because I had success with choosing BLUE and felt that it was probably a 1/4 chance of the partner choosing BLUE. 	In CONTRACT there's a high chance that I end up with a higher payoff than I would do in REPEAT
